Alex Smith's Election App 2016!
==============

This is one of my larger projects that I started right before the 2016 general election, though parts of it are from earlier work.

The project's stack is Mongo, Express, Node, Bootstrap, JQuery and JavaScript. It works through sessions, cookies, Mongoose, models, schema's, JSON, encryption, authentication, HTTP Authentication, middleware, template engines, mixins, modules, error-handling, REST API, HTML5, CSS, jQuery, csrf, query selector injection attacks, session-fixation attacks, cross-site scripting, https, request & response and Node's single-threaded server (maintaining asynchronous operations & nonblocking code). Order of operations & modules is very important!
